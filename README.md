# 🎉 My Core Java and Data Structures Journey 🚀

Welcome to my **personal playground** for **Core Java and Data Structures**! 🧩 This is where I’m starting from the basics, experimenting with code, and having fun while learning Java and exploring algorithms.

⚡ **Disclaimer**: This repository is not a professional guide—just a collection of things I’m learning and building for fun! If it helps someone along the way, that’s a bonus. 😊

## 📖 What’s in This Repo?
This repository is my **Java diary** as I explore:
- **Basic Java Concepts** 📝: From loops and conditionals to OOP, exceptions, and multithreading.
- **Data Structures** 🛠️: Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs.
- **Algorithms** 📊: Searching, sorting, recursion, dynamic programming, and more.
- **Random Challenges** 🎲: Fun problems I stumble across and try to solve.

## 🗂️ Folder Structure
Here’s how I’ve organized my experiments:
📂 src/
├── 🧩 basicPrograms/         # Starting from scratch: Hello World, Fibonacci, and more
├── 📊 ArraysAndArrayList/   # Array and ArrayList operations
├── 🌲 Searching/            # Linear, binary, and other search techniques
├── 📈 Sorting/              # Bubble, merge, quicksort, and custom sorts
├── 🎲 Recursion/            # Fun recursive challenges
├── ⚙️ DataStructures/       # Linked lists, stacks, trees, and graphs
└── 🧠 Algorithms/           # Algorithms like Dijkstra’s, knapsack, and more

## 🌟 Why This Repo?
1. **Starting Small**: I’m not trying to build something massive—just having fun with small programs and experiments.
2. **For the Joy of Coding**: This is my stress-free zone to write messy, experimental, and exciting code.
3. **Learning by Doing**: Every program here is something I wrote to learn, debug, and improve my Java skills.

## 🔧 How to Use
1. Clone this repo (if you want to):
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/core-java-ds-fun.git
   cd core-java-ds-fun

2. Open the project in any Java-friendly editor (Eclipse, IntelliJ, VS Code).

3.	Compile and run:
    javac src/path/to/YourProgram.java
    java path.to.YourProgram

4.	Play around with the code, modify it, and break it—it’s all part of the fun!


🌈 What’s Next?

This is not a roadmap, just a list of things I might get to:
	•	Add more fun Java basics like custom exception handling and multithreading.
	•	Build small projects (maybe a calculator or task manager?).
	•	Solve more challenging problems with recursion and dynamic programming.
	•	Experiment with advanced Java topics like streams and lambdas.
